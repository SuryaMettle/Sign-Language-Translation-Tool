Overview:
The Sign Language Translation Tool is a simple application that recognizes hand gestures from images and translates them into text. It uses OpenCV for image processing to detect hands and simulate gesture recognition.

Objectives:
Image Input: Accept an image file containing a hand gesture.
Hand Detection: Identify the hand in the image using color segmentation.
Gesture Recognition: Use a placeholder function to simulate the recognition of the sign language gesture.
Output: Display the original image with a bounding box around the detected hand and show the predicted gesture.
